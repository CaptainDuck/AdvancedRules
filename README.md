# AdvancedRules
_**The only fully-featured rules plugin you'll every need. (WIP).**_

>_**This plugin is only for PocketMine (MCPE) and third party softwares like [Genisys](https://github.com/iTXTech/Genisys) and/or [ImagicalMine](https://github.com/ImagicalMine/ImagicalMine).**_


> This plugin is Work in Progress (WIP) It means that it is In-Dev, Limited Features, and Some Errors.

> Special thanks to TheDragonRing for fixing some lines of code, adding permissions, and adding Rules.yml.

> Note: This Plugin is ONLY written on PHP so, You can't fit your Plugin on some MCPE Server Softwares like [MiNET](https://github.com/NiclasOlofsson/MiNET) Because it is written in C#


**_Note: This is my very first plugin, feel free to create any issue, suggestion or pull request. Thanks! :D_**
